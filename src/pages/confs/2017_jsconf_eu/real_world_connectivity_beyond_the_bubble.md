title: "Real world connectivity: Beyond the bubble"
description: "Every talk you’ll hear about ‘web performance’ will tell you that shaving 100ms from response time produced a 1% sales yield for Amazon, or maybe that 40% of web visitors will abandon your site when it takes more then 3 seconds to load? While those are impressive, there are some more interesting metrics that we need to talk about. Did you know that 43% of the humans on this planet have access to the internet, but 57% do not? Did you know that in 2016 India brought 100 million NEW users to the internet for the very first time? When you take a glance into the current state of global connectivity, you might realise that the internet you think you know so well exists on an entirely different plane. Through the guise of user-experience and empathy, we’ll study the state of global connectivity, connection speeds, population, and the costs of data in order to re-centre how we think about our role as designers and developers for the web today."

##### Notes

**State of global connectivity**
- 7.4 billion people, 53% don't have access to internet
- Data plans are very expensive depending on the region and normalized to the wages
- Average LTE speed also changes
- 60% of mobile connections are 2G
- At the moment, today, the Moto G4 would be the average phone
- Two version of the internet, the one that we use and the one we don't
  Fiber vs Airplane WIFI (and Lie-fi)

> We need to stop optimizing for 3000$ phones in fast connections

**Beyond Delivery, Asset Lifetime**
- Delivery
- Parse -> we often forget
- Runtime

On average, 410kb is the average of scripts on the web -> but it is really 3-4 Mb

Phones are slower (2x slower in general) at parsing JavaScript and other assets

> The metrics that we're currently using don't tell us much about user experience

- First Paint
- Visual Complete
- Time to interactive -> 5 seconds without long js tasks

> Don't try to keep people in your sites as long as possible, help the, achieve their goal fast

> The nature of the web is change.
