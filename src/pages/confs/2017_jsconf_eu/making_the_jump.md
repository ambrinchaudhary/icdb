title: "Making the Jump: How Desktop-Era Frameworks Can Thrive on Mobile"
description: "Today’s most popular frameworks come from a time when the world was a different place. Ember’s first rendering engine, for example, was optimized around the performance gotchas of Internet Explorer 6. IE6 has since faded into history, and smartphones with spotty connectivity and occasionally dodgy hardware have become the lowest common denominator that we must optimize for. In this talk, we’ll discuss how smartphones fundamentally change the assumptions we make about architecting applications for the web. Then, we’ll cover how we can embrace these new mobile constraints to build even better apps—for everyone. Finally, we’ll look at the techniques used by desktop-era libraries and what they’re doing to become great for the mobile web."

##### Notes
- How can things made for the desktop make the jump to the phones
- There are more differences than the obvious ones... how focused is the user?
- For many people, the first computer is a phone. The more global your app is, the more varied ecosystem you need to support
- Its easy to optimize for one combination at the cost of other
- Progressive Enhancement is the usual answer
- Browsers improve radically which doesnt seem to translate into applications

**The simplicity fetish**
- simple = small = fast = good
- complex = big = slow = bad

> Modern frameworks are compilers  

`Static Analysis vs Dynamic analysis`
`Render vs Re-render`
